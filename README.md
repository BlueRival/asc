asc
===

ASC (pronounced "ask"), stands for asynchronous, self-updating, cache. It serves as a middleware layer between a service and a client. The service could be an in-process library, a file, an external web service, anything. Any time the results from a resource call can be cached, you can use ASC as a proxy to that resource.
